Project: PREDICTIVE MODELING WITH LINEAR REGRESSION 
Implement a simple linear regression model using a dataset with continuous target variables. Split the data into training and testing sets, train the model on the training data, evaluate its performance using metrics like mean squared error or R-squared, and make predictions on the test set. Visualize the regression line and actual vs. predicted values to assess the model's accuracy.
